# Machine Learning and Kinetic Modeling of Syngas Fermentation

A machine learning project written in python that predicts time course concentrations of biofuel production from syngas fermentations with Clostridium carboxyidivorans.

The goal of this project is to measure the effects of training data augmentation and machine learning algorithm selection.

The training data was augmented by polynomial. Machine learning models were developed to predict production rates and product concentrations.

# An evaluation of machine learning algorithms in predicting Clostridium syngas fermentation outcomes with limited experimental data

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using machine learning to model production rates from syngas fermentation. In this study, we transformed time course metabolite concentration data from ten syngas fermentation conditions to calculate production rates of four products: acetate, ethanol, butyrate, and butanol. The data was used to train and test six machine learning algorithmsâ€™ ability to predict the rate of production of the four products. We found support vector machine performed the best on unseen testing data when performance across all conditions were considered. We also found that models with relatively few fitted variables, including elastic net and lasso, had the most consistent performance while models with more fitted variables, including neural networks and random forests, had greater variability in their prediction accuracy. Additionally, feature importance analysis was able to reproduce domain knowledge that the most important gas components for producing butyrate and butanol are carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas respectively.
